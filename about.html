                I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow with Princeton's Program in Public Economics; I work primarily with
                Dr. Owen Zidar. My research interests are at the top and the bottom of the U.S. income distribution, and in transit between
                these two points. I graduated from Harvard College in May 2019 with a
                bachelor's degree in applied mathematics <i>magna cum laude</i> and hope to earn a doctorate in economics.

                I wrote my senior thesis on whether job displacement affects demand for prescription opiates among displaced workers.
                Dr. David Cutler advised my thesis, and Dr. Anne Hall (Treasury) pushed me to consider the research question. I am
                currently revising my thesis and including more recent data releases into my existing empirical work, with the goal
                of submitting my work for publication. You can navigate above to my research tab to view an abstract for my senior
                thesis submission; I will post drafts of my updated work as they become available.

                I grew up in Richmond, Indiana, a small city (population ~40,000) located five minutes from the Ohio
                border. Though I've assimilated somewhat as a coastal elite during my time on the east coast, some important
                vestiges of my Midwestern upbringing remain: for example, I remain an ardent supporter of the Indiana
                Pacers and casseroles are virtually all I can cook. My approach to economic research is also informed by
                my upbringing. In particuar, I think it is important that research comes from individuals who have first-hand
                experience outside of upper middle-class suburban America, where virtually everyone graduates from high school,
                attends college, and earns a steady income. In this way, my upbringing has informed me to approach the issues
                I study with care, nuance, and at least some experiential understanding.

                When I'm not thinking about economics (and sometimes when I am), I moonlight as an amateur chorister (baritone).
                I sang with the mixed-voices chorus affiliated with the Harvard Music Department, namely, the Harvard-Radcliffe
                Collegium Musicum, for four years and am looking to join a new choir in Princeton. Some of my favorite
                pieces are Bach's B Minor Mass, Craig Hella Johnson's Considering Matthew Shepard, and Mozart's Requiem in D Minor.
