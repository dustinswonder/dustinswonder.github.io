                I'm currently an undergraduate at Harvard, set to graduate in May 2019 with a bachelor's degree in applied
                mathematics. I will start as a pre-doctoral research fellow in July 2019 with Princeton's Program in
                Public Economics; I will work primarily with Dr. Owen Zidar, but also with Drs. Ilyana Kuziemko and
                Henrik Kleven. I am primarily interested in inequality in the United States, particularly inequality
                of opportunity. To this end, I have completed coursework in applied labor economics and public finance.

                I am also currently writing a senior thesis on whether job displacement effects demand for prescription
                opiates among displaced workers. I will post drafts here as they become available. Dr. David Cutler is
                advising my thesis, and Dr. Anne Hall (Treasury) pushed me to consider the research question.

                I grew up in Richmond, Indiana, a small city (population ~40,000) located five minutes from the Ohio
                border. Though I've assimilated somewhat as a coastal elite during my time at Harvard, some important
                vestiges of my Midwestern upbringing remain: for example, I remain an ardent supporter of the Indiana
                Pacers and casseroles are virtually all I can cook. My approach to economic research is also informed by
                my upbringing. In particuar, I think it is important that at least some economic research comes from
                individuals who have first-hand experience outside of upper middle-class suburban America, where virtually
                everyone graduates from high school, attends college, and earns a steady income. Growing up in Richmond,
                a solidly Rust Belt city, motivated me to learn about inequality of opportunity, and I think my upbringing
                has informed me to approach the issues I study with care, nuance, and at least some experiential
                understanding.

                I identify strongly with a statement Dr. David Card made along these lines in an
                <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/interview-with-david-card">excellent interview</a>
                with Douglas Clement. Dr. Card is quoted as saying that every year, he does "a poll of [Berkeley doctoral]
                students and ask how many of their parents have Ph.D.s. That ratio is now close to 60 percent....We are getting a
                very select group of people...who have very different backgrounds from the average person in the country. I think that
                is a little troubling. It means our students don't really understand what a big leap it is for some families to send a
                child to college. They don't think about college as a difficult choice, because everybody in their family
                has high education, and all their friends went to college and will probably go further. We live in a stratified society."
