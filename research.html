                <h5>Effects of Job Displacement on Prescription Opiate Demand: Evidence from the Medical Expenditure
                Panel Survey." Thesis project/working paper. <a href="/Thesis_Draft_2_0.pdf">Draft</a> Last updated December 7, 2019.</h3>

                <b>Abstract: </b> This study uses micro data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to investigate
                whether job displacement affects the likelihood that prime-age workers use or abuse opioids. I show
                that displacement is not associated with changes in workers' likelihood of opioid use, except for at
                high use thresholds, at which point displacement appears to be associated with modest reductions in
                the probability of prescription opioid use. This relationship holds even among non-Hispanic whites and
                blue-collar workers, the workers highlighted in the burgeoning "deaths of despair" literature. I do
                find evidence that this association is mediated by the extent to which displacement causes financial
                hardship among workers. While estimates of the effect of displacement on opioid use will suffer from
                simultaneity bias under my specification due to my inability to observe the exact relative timing of
                displacement and opioid use, I am able to sign the simultaneity bias as positive by placing plausible
                restrictions on the model. Under these restrictions, the associations between opioid use indicators
                and job displacement indicators I observe are upper bounds on the effects of displacement on prescription
                opioid use, implying that the causal effect of displacement on likelihood opioid use is at most zero and
                possibly negative. My results would cast doubt on the hypothesis that labor market dislocations are an
                important driver of the opioid epidemic or the "deaths of despair" noted by Case and Deaton (2015; 2017).
